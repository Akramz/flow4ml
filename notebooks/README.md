# Analysis Notebooks

This directory is a placeholder for your analysis notebooks. Create notebooks here for specific workflow steps in your model development process.

## Data Acquisition and Validation

1. **Data Collection**: Scripts for downloading, scraping, or generating datasets
2. **Data Validation**: Validate data formats, distributions, and integrity
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Transform raw data into model-ready formats
4. **Feature Engineering**: Develop and test new features
5. **Data Visualization**: Explore data characteristics visually

## Experimentation Notebooks

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand your data distributions, class imbalances, and potential challenges
2. **Baseline Analysis**: Document baseline model performance and identify areas for improvement
3. **Error Analysis**: Investigate model failures and error patterns for targeted improvements
4. **Experiment Comparison**: Track metrics across experiments and visualize learning trends

## Best Practices

1. **Name notebooks clearly**: Use a numbering prefix (e.g., `01_data_acquisition.ipynb`) to maintain order
2. **Document your process**: Include markdown cells explaining reasoning and conclusions
3. **Organize into sections**: 
   - Problem statement
   - Data loading and processing
   - Analysis approach
   - Results
   - Conclusions and next steps
4. **Track configurations**: Record all parameters and settings
5. **Visualize results**: Create clear visualizations to highlight patterns

## Framework Integration

The notebooks you create should align with the Flow4ML iterative framework:
- Start with data acquisition and validation
- Build baselines for comparison
- Focus on systematic improvement cycles
- Document failures as well as successes
- Generate actionable insights for the next experiments

Your notebooks will serve as a living record of your ML development process, capturing reasoning, results, and the evolution of your approach.
