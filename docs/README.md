# Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the Flow4ML framework, including guides and best practices for developing machine learning models.

## Contents

- **Framework Guide**: Detailed explanation of the Flow4ML methodology
- **Best Practices**: Recommended approaches for efficient ML development
- **Project-specific Documentation**: Add custom documentation as your project evolves

## Framework Documentation

The documentation here should explain the specifics of your implementation of Flow4ML, including:

- Project goals and challenges
- Data sources and structures
- Model architectures considered
- Evaluation criteria and metrics
- Team-specific workflows

## Using External Tools for Tracking

As recommended in the main README, use external tools like Google Sheets for tracking experiments instead of storing tracking files in the repository. This keeps your repository clean while still maintaining comprehensive documentation of your progress.

## Extending the Documentation

As your project grows, consider adding:

- Project-specific guidelines
- Data schema documentation
- Deployment instructions
- Team workflows and processes
- Common issues and solutions

Keep documentation up-to-date as your project evolves to ensure knowledge is preserved and shared effectively.
